# Fibrillar Adhesin-like_proteins
Fibrillar adhesins are a class of proteins that mediate the bacterial binding activity [1]. They are characterized by their domain architecture, which is defined by multiple tandem stalk domains. These repeating domains build an elongated structure to project the adhesive domain away from the bacterial surface [2].

Based on known adhesive and stalk domains, we could identify 3,388 Fibrillar Adhesin-like (FA-like) proteins in the UniProt reference proteomes. The UniProt identifier and information about these proteins are given here, whereby they are split into the phyla and genera with the most detected FA-like proteins for a better overview.
