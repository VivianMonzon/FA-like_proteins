# Fibrillar Adhesin-like_proteins
Fibrillar adhesins are a class of proteins that mediate the bacterial binding activity ([Back CR., *et al*., 2020](https://www.jbc.org/content/295/19/6689)). They are characterized by their domain architecture, which is defined by multiple tandem stalk domains. These repeating domains build an elongated structure to project the adhesive domain away from the bacterial surface ([Rich RL., *et al*., 1998](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi981773r)).

Based on known adhesive and stalk domains, we could identify 3,388 Fibrillar Adhesin-like (FA-like) proteins in the UniProt reference proteomes. The UniProt identifier and information about these proteins are given here, whereby they are split into the phyla and genera with the most detected FA-like proteins for a better overview. Additionally, a summary of information to all detected FA-like proteins is given in 'FA-like_protein_infos.md/xlsx' file as well as information to the adhesive, stalk and anchor domains, which were used in this study.
